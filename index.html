                        I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in
                        the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny's worth.

                        "I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a
                        transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the
                        free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks
                        was the best and most grueling-time of my life. Since completing the course, I've successfully
                        switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.

                        Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them

                        The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program

                        capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention

                        "Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from
                        professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a
                        former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire
                        curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long
                        for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to
                        the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it
                        during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job
                        as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!"
